Artists like Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh have a way of capturing the essence of a moment with their brushstrokes and use of color.

I also enjoy contemporary art and exploring the intersection of traditional techniques with modern concepts. The art world is so diverse, and each style has its own unique beauty.

A work of oil paint on cardboard, this abstract expression known as Blue Rider was made in 1903 and displays a cloaked rider and their horse racing through meadows. According to Kandinsky, the blue colors used are meant to represent spirituality. Due to the abstract nature of the work, many have interpreted it in their own way with the speculation that the figure in the man’s arms must be a child, although truth be told, it may just be a shadow.",

For example, my favorite smoothie recipe calls for banana, lemon juice, mango, peaches, cucumber, spinach, ginger and turmeric. It’s extremely low calorie and you can hardly taste the veggies. Such a great way to sneak those in through out the day!\nYou can also experiment with other ingredients such as oats or nut butter.

We talked about our interests, hobbies, and even shared some funny stories. After the coffee, we decided to take a walk in Washington Square Park, which was just a short distance away. The park was beautifully lit up, and there was live music playing. It created such a romantic atmosphere. We strolled around, talked some more, and even sat down on one of the park benches to people-watch. He was really easy to talk to, had a great sense of humor, and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know me. It was a lovely evening, and I'm excited to see where this connection might lead!",

What's fascinating about the show is not just the heist itself, but the depth of the characters involved. Each of them has a distinct personality and backstory, which adds layers of complexity to the narrative. The show does an excellent job of blending action, psychological drama, and a bit of romance, keeping me on the edge of my seat.

I feel like Mike using his superpower was the hook that got us interested and should have been used way more in the show. Also, at times, it felt like they were undecided whether they wanted this to be a comedy or a drama.\nThe premise of their \"lawyering\" is basically \"hey you owe me this, do this for me\" and around the circle the same every time. And someone always had an ace in their sleeve, but they kept it for way too long, just use it and be done with it. How were they actually solving any of the cases while there was so much internal drama going around... Real law was bent so hard to fit the show, but I don't mind that part, it didn't take away from the story, they made it believable. There were no lawyer's deaths or judge's, which happen way more often in real life, that would have made the show more realistic. Mike going to prison made me interested in the show once again, I liked that season the most probably. Later down the road once Mike and Rachel left, I still enjoyed the show, didn't miss them one bit to be honest.",

With your new blonde hair, using a purple shampoo like Clairol Shimmer Lights is a great choice to keep any brassiness at bay.\nAs a blonde, here are a few extra tips for your hair care routine:\n- Look for products specifically formulated for blonde or color-treated hair. They help maintain your color and prevent fading.\n- Avoid harsh chemicals like sulfates and parabens, as they can strip color and dry out your hair.\n- Consider using a toner or a gloss treatment periodically to maintain the desired shade of blonde.\n- Be extra careful with heat styling.

It's great that you're looking into keratin-infused products as keratin helps strengthen and repair hair, especially with heat styling. For specific product recommendations, I suggest looking for reputable brands that specialize in hair care, as they often have well-researched formulas. Checking reviews, especially from people with similar hair types, can also be helpful.\nThe frequency of using keratin products depends on your hair type and condition. If you have damaged or color-treated hair, you might benefit from more frequent use. However, for normal hair, using a keratin heat protectant each time you apply heat can be sufficient. It's important to maintain a balance, as too much keratin can make hair stiff and brittle. If you notice your hair feeling hard or less elastic, it might be good to reduce the frequency.

      "parsedContent": "It sounds like you've found some products that work really well for your hair! The A'Pieu raspberry vinegar treatment seems like a great choice for softening and repairing, and it's great to hear that the Labiotte hair oil is nourishing without making your hair greasy.\nIf these products are giving you the results you want and you're happy with the health of your hair, it might be a good idea to stick with them. It's often beneficial to maintain a consistent hair care routine, especially when you've found products that suit your hair's needs.\nHowever, if you're looking to mix things up or address a different hair concern, you could consider exploring other products. Just remember, if you introduce new products, do it gradually to see how your hair reacts. It's all about finding the right balance for your hair's unique needs. How has your hair been feeling lately? Any specific concerns you're looking to address?",

Its lightweight, gel-based formula felt incredibly refreshing upon application. It's not greasy or heavy at all, making it perfect for daily use, even under makeup. As someone who has struggled with maintaining moisture in my facial skin, I'm always on the lookout for products that can provide the necessary nourishment without causing any adverse reactions.",

I just started using the Hydro Boost SPF and am loving it so far. It feels like an extra boost of hydration and goes on clear for me (though I'm super pale), with a subdued finish. It's like $10 a bottle and can be found at most stores you'd expect to find it.",

Also, this is great for your hair to make it shiny and silky.\nIf you wear makeup, WASH IT OFF EVERY NIGHT. No exceptions to this one.\nInstead of lotion, I use liquid coconut oil to moisturize after a shower. It has helped my KP more than any dermatologist, keeps it silky smooth and touchable, moisturizes like mad, and leaves a light sweet scent. If you can't find coconut oil, look for tubs of Eucerin. It is sent from the skin gods, though expensive.\nFor a face scrub since I have dry skin, I mix raw sugar with coconut oil and a bit of honey. Rinse and pat dry with a clean towel. I don't know if I'd suggest this for someone with oily skin, though.\nSomething a lot of people don't do because of the extra time it takes is PAT DRY with a dry towel after you step out of the shower. Rubbing can scrape your skin in ways it shouldn't be. Within 3 minutes of patting dry, apply moisturizer all over. The moisturizer locks in the water on the outer layers of your skin; it doesn't normally put more in. After about three minutes, all that good ole' H2O evaporates.",

Ojo Caliente, north of Santa Fe is my favorite, but they recently had a fire and I’m not sure if it has reopened. They have a sister property south of Santa Fe that looks nice. Both properties have lodging and spa amenities. Giggling Springs in in Jemez Springs are an easy day trip from Albuquerque. By far I think the best hot springs in Colorado are Pagosa Springs. Stay on the property; it’s worth the splurge!",

I think the amount of sessions varies depending on the office you go to and the area where you’re getting lasered, but I only did 5 sessions I think? And I haven’t had to shave in years, so again, worth it for me 👌. If you’ve already had your first session, I would just stick it out until it’s complete",
