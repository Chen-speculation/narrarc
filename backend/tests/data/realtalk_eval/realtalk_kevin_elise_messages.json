People always ask me what’s my secret because my hair looks waaay “healthier” than it should. When I tell them olive oil masks, I almost always lose them right there. The next thing they universally say? “What about coconut oil?!” UGH. Coconut oil gets on my nerves. Yes, it’s colorless, smells great, and is so damn trendy you feel like you fit in just by using it. But when it became a huge deal several years ago, I decided to give it a go… And I hated the results. My hair felt stiff and sticky, not at all soft like how my olive oil masks turn out. So ever since I’ve been on a crusade against it. If you want my step-by-step olive oil mask routine, PM me and I’ll copy/paste it from my notes.\nOlaplex. I was the BIGGEST skeptic of Olaplex. I didn’t even try it until January of 2018 when I had gotten a shadow root, hated it, and my stylist (love her so much) had to do some crazy stuff to bleach it out. She convinced me to try Olaplex and my hair LOVED it! It’s the best thing to happen to blondes since toner. Imagine the bleaching process is a home invasion robber who kicks your hair’s front door in. Olaplex comes along, shuts the door, and sweeps the porch. I’m very against the term “miracle” product; it’s not magic. It’s technology called a bond builder, which repairs the broken bonds from bleaching, coloring, heat, etc. It instantly makes the hair stronger, softer, and smoother. Don’t overdo it—once or twice a month is fine. Olaplex No. 3 is the take home version that you’d use. Apply to damp hair, let it sit for 20-30 minutes, then shampoo and condition afterwards (very important).",

Drink water, get enough sleep (around 8 hours), eat a mix of healthy foods, watch out for too much sugar and processed stuff, and limit caffeine and alcohol.\nTaking vitamins like C and D is smart, and doing some cardio (like walking or jogging) a few times a week is good. Also, lifting weights a couple of times is nice for strength.\nDon't forget to spend time with friends and family regularly, and try to read instead of using screens before bed. Oh, and if possible, plan a vacation every 6 months for a good break!",

My suggestion is Spin a couple/few times a week and a weight program, as well. Sometimes gyms offer a group weights-style program (like a \"bootcamp\" or \"circuit training\" sort of deal). Spinning will improve your cardio conditioning. If you combine it with eating less, you'll lose fat, but not as efficiently as if you also add in weight training.

Regardless of how it looks at the beach you usually don't have to go out far in a boat before it clears up.\nThe clarity is always better in Florida since the silt gets pushed our way. That being said I have experienced red tides 2 of the last 3 times I have been to the Florida Gulf Coast. Water looked great but the closer you got the more your eyes burned and there were dead fish everywhere.",
